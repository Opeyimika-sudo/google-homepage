This project is a mock of the Google homepage.
I used HTML and CSS.
I tried to get as close as I could to the real site, even using the links on the real site so incase you hover and click and find yourself somewhere else entirely :)
I tried to search Google a lot to figure out how to insert a search icon into the search bar, how to position the footer the way it is on Google's homepage, and so on.
I am so glad that I have my first project on Github and I hope that in a year or two, I can check back to this project and go bollocks.
Thanks for reading
